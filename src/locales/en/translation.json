Once a change has been saved to the plan, the current week's view of the users exercises will then show the changed plan. As a result, all days of the week will show the exercises as not done. The streak is still maintained, but now for the current day (also) the exercises from the new plan must be done. On such days the calendar will also continue to show only the exercises done from the old plan.",
    "q-03": "What happens when a training plan is deleted?",
    "a-03": "When a plan is deleted, all users who it was previously assigned to will be shown an \"empty\" plan. As long as the users do not have a plan, their streak will not be increased (but also not reset) and no XP / level can be gained.",

    "a-07": "No, users can simply do this themselves via the login page. There is a button \"Forgot password?\" which can be used to reset the password. An email with a link will then be sent to the user, which can be used to select a new password."
